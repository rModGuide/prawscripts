# prawscripts

This is simply a test concept/idea for merging together all public scripts we have and putting a wrapper for it,  
given permission from the original author.

Installation package at https://pypi.org/project/prawscripts/0.0.9/

The main dependency should mainly just be PRAW at this time.

Open to contributors from r/ModGuide for uploading/reuploading new/existing functions and testing if package is  
working properly.

To install it on your computer, run:

pip3 install prawscripts

As it requires PRAW to run, it will install PRAW as a dependency.
